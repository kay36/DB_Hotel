Problem statement

Subject area: hotel. The database should implement:
· records of the reservation;
· get a list of rooms available (by number of seats and class);
· get a list of rooms (beds), released today and tomorrow;
· the results information on a particular number;
· automation of the issuance of invoices for payment for the accommodation and services;
· get a list of rooms booked;
· check reservation on behalf of the client and/or organization name.

In my database, I have identified the following main entities:
· Booking Information
· Customers
· Rooms
